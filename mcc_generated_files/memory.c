  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the MEMORY driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

  @Description
    This file provides implementations of driver APIs for MEMORY.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.76
        Device            :  PIC18F45K22
        Driver Version    :  2.0.2
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 2.00
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 5.10
